# color-detection-using-python
finds color of your given input jpg file 

There are around 16 million colors according to different RGB color values, but a human mind can only remember quite a few.
It is common that after seeing the color, you are still not able to name the color. 
In this data mining project, you are going to build an amazing app which is going to help in recognizing color from any image. 
All you need is a labeled data of available colors and then the program runs to evaluate which color resembles most with the selected color value and helps in detecting colors easily. You can use the Python programming language in which Codebrainz Color Names dataset will be used for the project.
